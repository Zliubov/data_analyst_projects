## Project Analysis of Mobile App User Behavior and A/A/B Testing for Font Change

#### Project Description

The project involves studying the behavior of mobile app users of a food products startup, specifically analyzing the sales funnel to determine how users reach the point of purchase, how many users successfully complete a purchase, and which steps cause users to get "stuck". The project also involves conducting multiple A/A tests and A/B tests to determine whether changing the fonts throughout the app will affect user behavior. The tests were conducted with a significance level of 0.05% and later at a significance level of 0.1, but there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. The conclusion is that changing the font is unlikely to produce a meaningful result, and the safer option is to move on to the next test. The positive conclusion from the tests is that the platform performs well in terms of flow distribution, as the control A/B test shows that users behave very similarly, with only around a 1% difference between the groups.
