## Project Moscow Catering Market Analysis

#### Project Description
Project is a data analysis project that aims to provide feedback on choosing the right location for the upcoming catering establishment in Moscow. 
The project involves analyzing a dataset of catering establishments in Moscow collected from Yandex Maps and Yandex Business. The goal is to identify interesting features of the catering market in Moscow and present the results in a concise and informative way. The project involve using various tools and visualization techniques such as matplotlib, seaborn and folium to create compelling visuals that will help the investors make informed decisions.

## Project Analysis of Mobile App User Behavior and A/A/B Testing for Font Change

#### Project Description

The project involves studying the behavior of mobile app users of a food products startup, specifically analyzing the sales funnel to determine how users reach the point of purchase, how many users successfully complete a purchase, and which steps cause users to get "stuck". The project also involves conducting multiple A/A tests and A/B tests to determine whether changing the fonts throughout the app will affect user behavior. The tests were conducted with a significance level of 0.05% and later at a significance level of 0.1, but there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. The conclusion is that changing the font is unlikely to produce a meaningful result, and the safer option is to move on to the next test. The positive conclusion from the tests is that the platform performs well in terms of flow distribution, as the control A/B test shows that users behave very similarly, with only around a 1% difference between the groups.

## Project Hypothesis Prioritization and A/B Testing for an Online Shop

#### Project Description

The project involves conducting an A/B test for an online shop and analyzing the results. In the first part of the project, hypotheses are prioritized using the ICE and RICE frameworks based on parameters such as Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort. In the second part of the project, the A/B test results are analyzed by plotting cumulative revenue, average receipt, number of orders, and relative changes in these metrics for both groups. Dot plots are constructed to identify abnormal users and orders, and statistical significance is calculated for differences in average number of orders and order receipts between the groups on raw and cleaned data. Based on the results, a decision is made on whether to stop or continue the test.
