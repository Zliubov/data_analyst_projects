## Project steps
**Exploratory Data Analysis**.

This stage involves visualising and summarising customer data to identify patterns and trends, and selecting appropriate characteristics for customer segmentation.



**Segmentation of bank customers**.

This step involves segmenting the bank's customers into no more than 4 main categories based on the number of products used and the churn rate.
It is also necessary to assess the degree of similarity between the different categories and to draw a final boundary between the categories.


**Statistical analysis of the data**.

In this step, statistical methods are used to further investigate and verify the segments obtained in the segmentation stage.
Testing the hypothesis of a difference in income between customers who use two banking products and those who use one.
Formulate and test the second statistical hypothesis in relation to the data presented (preliminary - are there differences in the balance of those who leave the bank and those who remain).



**Preparing the presentation**.

Creating of a dashboard.
Final conclusions and recommendations. 
Preparation of the research presentation for a bank manager.
